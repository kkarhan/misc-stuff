# Serial Harassers and other "hobbyless people"
### Statement re: reactions to [my previous post](publications/statements/20221102/hey-twitter.md)

Sometimes I wounder what people motivatates.

Apparently [some hobbyless serial-harassers] took their time to [create a GitHub Account solely to harrass me](https://github.com/OstDeutschAntiFa), [mock my last post](https://github.com/OstDeutschAntiFa/misc-stuff), harrass me with a [pull request](https://github.com/kkarhan/misc-stuff/pull/1) as well as [commit cyber-vandalism in other projects](https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/issues/16).

On one hand, I should be thankful for the "free pentesting" and reminding me to exercise proper security.

I can accept assholes harrassing me personally out of [hobbylessness](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1578748399867727872) and narcism. 
### What I cannot stand however, are attempts of [framing me with blatant lies](https://twitter.com/XphMcIntyre/status/1588230005473304576)
I mean, everyone who even remotely takes their time knows that [made up bs](https://twitter.com/XphMcIntyre/status/1587926676310093826) trying to [frame me for terrorism](https://twitter.com/XphMcIntyre/status/1587923754780610560).

If any of [these outrageous claims were true](https://twitter.com/XphMcIntyre/status/1587914798414454784) I'd obviously not be able to post this reply without having at least being visited by the police.
Fortunately, [SWATting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting) doesn't work well in Germany and since [their claims always turn out to be made-up](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1569478340431728641) they'd rather get charged with [False Suspicion](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__164.html) than me getting ever handcuffed or questioned for bs.

[I also predicted their reactions and tactics to the point.](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1580384207758831617)

Basically, that shitshow started with [deranged rambings](https://twitter.com/L_isaMarie/status/1569459157883047937) of a [Type B](https://twitter.com/AdamKinzinger/status/1571267661807370242) narccistic woman, which in hindsight I had the ([retroactively stupid](https://twitter.com/in_annoyed/status/1582105542968848384)) idea to [reply in good faith](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1569463050734018560) and clear up misconceptions.

What followed was [a massive "carpet bombing" with false accusations](https://twitter.com/hashtag/HoldTransRescueAccountable) against anyone that follows me back, including [DM Spamming](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1580380882816622592) of my contacts from [an account](https://mobile.twitter.com/TransAdviceOrg) that I'd call [sus](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sus) at best, if not [an obvious psyop at most](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1580381654702387201).

The [continued attacks](https://twitter.com/L_isaMarie/status/1590482985073381376) against [TransRescue](https://twitter.com/Trans_Rescue) are [solely done in bad faith to paralize their ability](https://transrescuewatch.medium.com/the-trans-rescue-papers-when-help-looks-more-like-human-trafficking-exploitation-4e3d7886bfbc) to [save peoples' lives](https://transrescue.org/).

It's just [too coincidential](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1578753585411608576) that this all happened whilst I supported [others](https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/graphs/contributors) with [#DropKiwifarms](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1582708957277102081).

At this point I'm millimeters before seeking professional legal consultation to see what can be done with that crap, espechally regarding holding [handle-changing](https://twitter.com/DorkySophie) [harrassers](https://twitter.com/XphMcIntyre) contempt for damages should their actions result in more, espechally off-platform harrasment and negative impacts on my reputation and income, [forcing me to reduce activity on a professional social media platform](https://www.xing.com/profile/Kevin_Karhan).

Not that I'd be scared - [far from it](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1561859648256442372), but unlike the made-up accusations [I don't believe in vigligantism](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1569476892729954306) but [rule of law and due process](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1569475655200391170) as I don't need to [dehumanize anyone](https://twitter.com/L_isaMarie/status/1571518588229685249).

We've all seen with [KiwiFarms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_Farms), organized serial harrasment doesn't stop with "just mean words on the internet".
###### But don't worry: All legal precautions and contingencies have been taken and in my opinion, noone ever dared to show up.

#### So behave yourselves everyone and don't get any bad ideas... They don't deserve the "Honor of Martyrdom" by engineering a shallow self-victimization campaign that solely aims .
Also the ["Muskverse" is rotting](https://twitter.com/Grownded/status/1589760967034142721) faster than unchilled raw chicken in tropical heat!

I do get the feeling that their [Mass False Reporting](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1569785196819406855) was well-timed after [the Mastodon Instance](https://mastodon.starrevolution.org) [I used](https://mastodon.starrevolution.org/@k3vk4) was either shut down or rather got their [domain squatted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_drop_catching) by [rentseeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) [Registrars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_front_running), a common practice of corporate [Cybersquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting).
#### [I guess this is the "FreezePeach"](https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/1587512647578095617) [Elon Musk wants](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1589390597798125568)...
Don't try to get me wrong:
As I stated in my [previous post](publications/statements/20221102/hey-twitter.md), I'd gladly follow any reasonable rule, but what I do expect from Twitter is [consistency](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1553772021913456641), and [retroactively criminalizing stuff that was previously seen as good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_bis_in_idem) is only undermining their reputation.

### Also: Hey Twitter [that button is still dysfunctional](https://twitter.com/account/access). Are you going to try to lock me out like several fellow friends in the past?
