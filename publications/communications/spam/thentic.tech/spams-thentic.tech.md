Dear Thentic Team,
first of all, you should know that unsolicited eMail ads are known as Spam, which is a felony in Germany.

Furthermore I find your non-personalized message to be insultingly bland towards my intellect as you haven't even referenced the projects in question.

And finally I'd like you to explain yourself and give me a reason why I should not report said Spamming to Regulators [i.e. BNetzA] and your eMail Hoster [Twilio Sendgrid]...



Should I not hear from you then I assume you're just a Spam operation, thus seek legal advice on how to enforce my rights as a consumer as per BDSG & GDPR as well as potentially seek a permanent injunction against crawling, storing, processing, handing-over or selling any data about me to anyone as there is no "legitimate interest" of yours beyond a [presumably existing] eMail archival system in compliance with GoBD & HGB storing this message.

After all it's YOUR responsibility to enshure YOUR spammy ads comply with the laws of the recipients' juristiction!

And to enshure we're on the same page I've already pushed your domain to a blocklist I maintain and most users will likely update their copy in the next 24-48 hours [most do daily at like 00:00 local like myself]...
https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/commit/6d4619f08c53eddea62ccdd67b96f95a73bd6313




Yours Faithfully,

Kevin Karhan




PS: Only unsigned and unencrypted eMails of yours will get blocked.
You'll find my Pubkey attached to this message.

PPS: The accessibility of your eMail [White on White Text] should alone be considered attempted assault against my eyes.
Including the light-gray on white for your legal adress...
And no, I won't klick your shitty tracker links!

So you do admit that you're just scraping GitHub and didn't even bother to check if the people you're spamming are living within a juristiction where this is permissible?
Well, that's your problem - not mine!

I'll give you one last opportunity why I shouldn't report your non-consenting and felonious spam to everyone from Sendgrid to GitHub and BNetzA if not press charges for spamming.

As for calling you out, I'll publicly name and shame your company until you cease to spam people.
https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/blob/cdef58d253bd3cb8b4f804507870a492767107d4/spammers.domains.block.list.tsv#L12

Just be glad Twilio hasn't requested a removal as of now, because then I'd be obligated to disclose the whole ordeal to them...
https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/blob/cdef58d253bd3cb8b4f804507870a492767107d4/spammers.domains.block.list.tsv#L17


Will you cease scraping data and/or attempting to collect, store or process any data about me or do you first need a cease and decist letter?
Because those costs would obviously be on you as my communications will be evidence to showcase my ability and willingness to resolve the situation amicably.

Also since you transmitted my personal data in an insecure [aka. unencrypted manner] that too is a potential offense and clear violation of BDSG standards.
You had my Public Key to encrypt the reply with - you chose not to use it [and even if you hadn't that would not be a viable excuse] ...

scam


On a more funny note: Are you just incompetent or naive?
Because people who work on Monero or find it interesting are most likely not interested in "web3" scams like NFTs and the like, but rather repulsed by it.

Phrases like "Please be assured that we respect your data privacy rights and have taken steps to address your concerns." are insulting to my intellect to the point that I'm seriously considering to publish this entire ordeal at my own discretion to let others know that you don't even fake to give a damn.

Just because information is publicly accessible doesn't mean you get to stalk people based off GitHub interactions and spam their personal inbox with non-consensual trash.

If you were some recruiter or actually providing some value I would've taken my time to at least listen to your offers.
But if you were saying the same words you wrote to me in person on my doorstep I'd tell you to leave the premises before I'd call the police for trespassing and stalking.
Others may not be that well-behaved and kind - neither offline nor online, but I'm neither supporting nor condoning their actions...




PS: The fact that you don't seem to have any Pubkey [or at least neither bothered to sign nor encrypt] your response completely disqualifies you for any serious work in regards to Cryptography, Privacy, Finance, or generally IT Security.

But then again your website doesn't even have any security.txt file, so I can assume it's a shell company solely setup to fleece tech-illiterate VCs off their ill-gotten wealth and burn through their cash...

```
So let me recap this:

1. You obtained my eMail adress in automated ways and without my explicit consent, which is illegal as you have no "legitimate interest" in contacting me, an individual.
2. You illegally cold-mail me [ https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/uwg_2004/__7.html ] as individiual.
3. You continue to harass and cyberstalk me despite my explicit demand never to be contacted again.
4. You continue to collect, store, handle my personal data against my explicit demand despite having no "legitimate interest" in doing so.
5. Your Website [ https://thentic.tech/ ]  violates German Law by not having mandatory Legal Info displayed, including legal adress, named CEO, Tax-ID, Regulating Authority and -License.
6. You continue to operate an illegal business with apparently no registration in Berlin [otherwise you'd proubly present it on your website].
7. You continue to operate an illegal FinTech business with apparently no permit by BaFin to do so [otherwise you'd proubly present it on your website].


My only question at this point is if you intent to flee like a coward or actually owe up to your wroingdoings.
Because it's only due to my personal lazyness that I've not pressed charges for violating my privacy and harassing me - so don't push me!



Had you simply apologized and followed my request to stop spamming me, I would've not taken a look into your business, but since you did not, I'm now knowing about said things and I can't ignore these facts.

And since your lack of transparency, petty form of communication and gross neglect in basic due diligence for a business leads me to believe that your business acts as a front for non - bona-fide activities, I feel obligated to let the authorities know about it.

Espechally since Cryptocurrencies and NFTs are a known tools to commit money laundering, violate sanctions and commit to crime and terrorism financing.



I've also taken the liberty to let all your suppliers know and I'm shure they'll fire you instead of being denylisted.
https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/blob/main/spammers.domains.block.list.tsv#L14

After all, I did my part in taking down far bigger operations than your tiny crypto grift...



Wishing you - retroactively - a nice Unification Day,

Kevin Karhan
